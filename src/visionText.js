            <p>A bright star is a brilliant being and we believe the bright star spirit is intrinsic to the human experience. Bright stars are most dazzling when in a community called a constellation, just like human beings. </p>
            <p>We feel lucky that, as twins, we have been sources of light to guide and reflect one another. Growing up we felt brightest when lost in our imagination. As adults itâ€™s easy to lose the freedom that comes with being lost. Kids innately see the world as magic. Every scribble is a work of art, while mud, dirt and sand create faraway lands.</p>
            <p>Our vision for the Bright Star Spirits Kids Collective is to foster that sense of freedom, embrace imagination, and make more magic moments by being fully present with ourselves and the world around us.</p>
